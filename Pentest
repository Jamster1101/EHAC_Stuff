Penetration test report plan.

Pentest steps:
Planning, Enumeration, Exploitation, Escalation, Reporting.

1. Executive Summary
Objective: Describe the goal of the penetration test (e.g., test resilience of X system).
Scope: State systems, domains, IP ranges, apps, employees, etc., in scope.
Test Type: Black-box / White-box / Gray-box.
Methodology Overview: Briefly list the 5 stages used.
High-Level Findings: Number of vulnerabilities, severity summary.
Recommendations Summary: Main strategic improvements.

2. Methodology (Use the 5 Pentest Stages)
PLANNING
Describe:
Targets chosen (data, server, employee, etc.).
Legal boundaries & consent.
Pre-engagement information gathering.

Tools/Commands:
ping, whois, nmap -sS -A, nc

ENUMERATION
Describe:
Live hosts, open ports, OS/service detection.
Account enumeration, SMB shares, social engineering prep.

Tools/Commands:
nmap, enum4linux-ng, passive monitoring.

EXPLOITATION
Describe:
Methods used (e.g., XSS, SQLi, buffer overflow).
What was compromised?
Demonstrated impact.

Example:
http://target.com/page?param=' OR '1'='1

ESCALATION
Describe:
Privilege escalation methods.
Lateral movement in the network.
Data exfiltration / credentials obtained.

Tools/Commands:
sudo -l, misconfig analysis.

REPORTING
Organize:
Tables, graphs, charts of findings.
Severity ratings (CVSS if known).
Proof of concepts (sanitized).
Specific recommendations.

Tools/Commands:
nikto -h <target>

3. Findings Section (Detailed)
For each vulnerability:
Name: e.g., SQL Injection on login.
Description: What was the flaw?
Impact: What could an attacker do?
Proof of Concept: Include redacted or safe example.
Risk Level: Low / Medium / High / Critical.
Recommendations: Patching, configuration, training, etc.

4. Recommendations
Grouped by priority or area:
Patch X and Y immediately (High risk)
Change default credentials
Disable unnecessary services
Enforce least privilege policy
Conduct employee awareness training

5. Appendices
Tools used
Raw output (redacted)
Nmap scans
Commands/scripts executed

TIPS FOR THE EXAM
Follow the 5-stage structure clearly.
Always write as if the reader is non-technical (for summary).
Use bullet points to organize findings neatly.
Keep one or two tool examples in each section to demonstrate technical knowledge.
